### Applying Modifiers
- **Animation Modifiers**: These modifiers offer simple and group followers for spline-based animations. They come equipped with an advanced event system to facilitate interactive spline following, ideal for applications like train systems.
- **Mesh Modifiers**:  Modifiers in this category offer procedural mesh generation capabilities. Please note that the mesh generation section is a separate package available for purchase on the Unity Asset Store. It provides options such as plane mesh, tube mesh, extrude mesh, and mesh deform to create procedural meshes along the spline.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Mesh Modifiers are not directly integrated into Spline Plus. Instead, they are part of a separate package known as Spline Mesh Deform. This package encompasses both Spline Plus functionalities and additional mesh modifiers, providing users with a comprehensive set of tools for spline manipulation and mesh deformation.
